// These screens are essentially “smart” container component that
// handle all of the data fetching, interaction management, etc. 
// The actual UI is delegated down to the various presentation 
// components in the components directory. With that being said you 
// should very rarely, if ever, have style information in “screen”. 
// his allows them to stay hyper focused.
